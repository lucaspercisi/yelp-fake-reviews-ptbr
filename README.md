# Detection of Fake Reviews in Portuguese Using Machine Learning

## About the Project
This project focuses on detecting fake reviews on online review platforms, specifically in Portuguese. We use advanced techniques in machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish genuine reviews from fraudulent ones.

### Context
Online reviews play a significant role in influencing consumers' purchasing decisions. However, the emergence of fake reviews can distort consumer perception and undermine the integrity of online platforms. This project aims to address this issue in the context of the Portuguese language, which is less explored in the scientific literature on the subject.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can efficiently identify fake reviews in Portuguese, contributing to the integrity and reliability of online platforms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected from the [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) website, focusing on reviews of bars and restaurants in Brazil and Portugal.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset includes various features, such as review content, user behavioral data, and meta-features extracted from the review text.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** We used web scraping techniques to collect reviews.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and organizing the data, including removing stopwords, lemmatization, and POS-tagging.
- **Feature Extraction:** Exploration of textual and behavioral features.
- **Modeling:** Implementation and testing of various machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVC, XGBoost, among others.
- **Cross-Validation:** Using 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models.

## Results
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in distinguishing between genuine and fake reviews, with detailed analyses available in the repository.
